# Moussa Sahli's test project for the application to Scandiweb's React.js Developer position 
* first of all, thank you for considering me for this position, giving me the chance to have this experience and for taking the time to review this project and mentor me. No matter what your final decision would be, I will come out a winner at the end of it all by improving as a web developer.

# About the project
* This Web-App is best optimised for a 1920x1080 resolution tough it will work on all PC grade screen sizes, when using resolutions as in the Figma design it will match the latter perfectly. 
* I used react-router-dom to have an SPA, redux toolkit to manage the state and I chose graphql-request as my graphql client, lightweight and convenient for this project.
* I used react-dom-router@5 instead of @6 due to v6's compatibility issues with class based components.
* The app's state will not be preserved throughout page reloads, my reasoning behind this is that if i wanted to maintain the state I would probably resort to using LocalStorage for this project which will not prove anything and is not the approach I'd take in a real project. It would only unnecessarily over-engineer the app. 
* When clicking on the green add to cart button on the PLP, it will only add the product to the cart if it has no attributes else it will redirect you to PDP where you have to select its attributes. (this was one of the suggested solutions in the Q&A section)
* Graphql server must be hosted on port 4000 for the app to work. 
* It took me around a week to finish this project.
